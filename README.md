## Using machine learning to detect hate speech and offensive language through instant messaging
My project is going to be a machine learning model that when trained using appropriate data will be able to detect hate speech and offensive messages. To test and showcase the possibilities of what to do once the messages have been detected, I will be using the Discord API to make a discord bot. I will be using the discord.py wrapper which is written in python.

## Motivation
Since the invention of the internet, one of the most used technologies is instant messaging. While this is not bad in anyway, it brings along a new way to spread offensive and hateful messages and statements. Especially in a medium such as Discord where there are many young users and no built-in moderation or detection of such messages. Users can be exposed to very hateful and offensive messages at an age where they should not. This is the problem I am attempting to solve in this final year project. I am going to be using Machine Learning and NLP to detect Hate speech and Offensive messages real time and use the built-in tools in discord to deal with the messages through various methods.

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation & How to use
clone the repository
install all the required libaries, either download the pretrained model or run main.ipynb in prototype3 folder to train your own model
create a .env file with DISCORD_TOKEN={your token}
once model is trained run main.py
